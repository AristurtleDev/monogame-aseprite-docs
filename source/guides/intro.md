# MonoGame.Aseprite

![MonoGame.Aseprite Banner](~/images/banner.png)
**MonoGame.Aseprite** is a free and open source library for the [MonoGame Framework](https://www.monogame.net) that assist in importing [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) files into your game project.  No need to export a spritesheet from Aseprite and ahve to deal with PNG + JSON import.  With **MonoGame.Aseprite**, you can use the Aseprite file directly.

**MonoGame.Aseprite** is a translation layer on top of my other library [AsepriteDotNet](https://github.com/aristurtledev/asepritedotnet).  **AsepriteDotNet** performs all of the file parsing and loading, then **MonoGame.Aseprite** provides utility classes to transform that data into commonly used types in a game such as **Sprite**, **TextureAtlas**, **SpriteSheet**, **Tileset**, and **Tilemap**.  

> [!CAUTION]
> If you plan to work only with the `AsepriteFile` and not use the utility types from the `MonoGame.Aseprite` library provided, it might be more beneficial for you to use the [AsepriteDotNet](https://github.com/aristurtledev/asepritedotnet) base library instead.
