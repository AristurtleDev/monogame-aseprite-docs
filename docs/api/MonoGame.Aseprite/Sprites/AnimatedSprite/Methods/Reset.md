**Declaring Type:** [AnimatedSprite](../)  
**Namespace:** [MonoGame.Aseprite.Sprites](../../)  
**Assembly:** MonoGame.Aseprite

Resets this [AnimatedSprite](../) back to its initial state as defined by the [AnimationTag](../../AnimationTag/) used to create it.  You will need to call [Play(int?)](Play.md)after resetting to start the playback of the animation.s

```csharp
public void Reset();
```

## Remarks

This is useful if you've adjusted the [IsReversed](../Properties/IsReversed.md) or [IsPingPong](../Properties/IsPingPong.md) properties, or specified a override to the loop count when initially playing the animation.

This also resets the [Speed](../Properties/Speed.md) to `1.0d`.
